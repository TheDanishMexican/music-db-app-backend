# Music Database App
Welcome to our music database app!

## Getting Started

To run this app correctly, follow these steps:

---
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the music-db-app-backend-danielBranch folder on your local machine.

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

+ " npm install "

This ensures that you have all the required packages installed.

---
2. Start the server by running the command:

+ "npm start"

This will initiate the server, and you should see the following message logged in your terminal:

" App listening on port 3000
Tracks Endpoint: https://test-for-database-project.azurewebsites.net/tracks "

---
3. You can now proceed to the README in the frontend repository for further guidance.
